# Future Home

Welcome to Future Home, the website that will allow you to browse and find your dream house!

Site viewers can access the home page, in order to get an idea of the content of the website. They are able to easily gaze at the list of listings and view the details of each listing. if they wish to like listings, ask questions or book viewings, they can also sign up to the site through the registration form. 
Lastly, they can connect through the social media located in the footer.

Registered Site Users can like/unlike listing, ask questions related to the individual listing and book viewings. 

Questions and booking need to be approved by the Site Admin. 
The admin can also create, update and delete listing, directly from the webpage.

## Testing 

- I tested this page in different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari.
- The project is responsive, and it looks and works well on different browsers and screen sizes.
  ![Future Home](./static/images/mockup.webp)


### Validator Testing 
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator:
    - [Home Page](./static/images/html_test.png)


- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]()
    - [Home Page](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=it&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffuture-home.herokuapp.com%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)


- Python
  - I used [Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and one error was returned on the settings.py file:
    - Line 128 is too long (87 characters over 79 allowed), but unfortunately it is not possible to modify it.
    [Settings.py](./static/images/Settings.py.png)

  - The remaining Python files did not show any errors:
    - [Asgi.py](./static/images/asgy_py.png)
    - [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_py.png)
    - [Wsgi.py](./static/images/wsgi_py.png)
    - [Admin.py](./static/images/admin_py.png)
    - [Apps.py](./static/images/apps_py.png)
    - [Forms.py](./static/images/forms_py.png)
    - [Models.py](./static/images/models_py.png)
    - [Tests.py](./static/images/tests_py.png)
    - [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_app_py.png)
    - [Views.py](./static/images/views_py.png)


- Accessibility
  - Performance, accessibility and best practices were assessed through Lighthouse in devtools and passed the testing with good scores.
    ![Lighthouse](./static/images/lighthouse.png)
  - The Performance score might be improved converting the .png files in .webp files, in order to compress the images and facilitate the upload when the page is loaded. For lack of time, I did not convert them, but it is certainly an improvement that can be made.


### Manual Testing

- Navigation Bar:
  - The "Future Home" logo redirects to the home page when clicked.
  - The  "Home" button on the navigation bar redirects to the Home page when clicked.

  - When signing in, a green pop-up message confirms that we are now logged in with our username.
  - The Navigation bar is fully responsive and it was tested on larger screens where the features are listed on the top right of the page, and on smaller screens, where it looks compressed in a menu icon, that opens up below to show the pull list of features.
- Home Page:
  - Every time that the home page is loaded, the main image containing the logo and the brand name feature a zooming animation, obtained through CSS.
  - Clicking on any of the listing titles will open that listing, showing the main details relative to that listing.
  - The pagination of the listings has been set to 3 per row on larger screens, and only one on smaller screens. The pagination is fully responsive, and was tested on large and small screens.
- Opening a listing:
  - If the user is not logged in, it is only possible to view the listing details, the number of likes and comments, and the questions asked and answered.
  - It is possible to create an account clicking on the relevant text, that changes colour and becomes highlighted when hovered on. The feature works and opens the Sign Up page.

  - As an Admin, it is also possible to delete the listing. Clicking on the red "Delete Listing" button (that changes colour when hovered on) opens a new page requesting the confirmation to delete that listing. Clicking "Delete" allows the Admin to delete the listing without accessing the Admin panel. The feature has been tested and works well.
  - As an Admin, it is possible to add a question or a comment on the specific listing, and the feature has been tested and works well.
- Security:
  - If a user attempts to log into the admin panel from the URL, they are redirected to a login screen that requires credentials in order to access restricted features of the website.
  - All Admin-only features have been tested and do not appear as editable for other users (both logged in or non-logged in).


### Fixed Bugs
- Removed migrations made during design, using "python3 manage.py migrate futurehomeapp 0017", as 0017 included features that were removed before final deployment.
- Pictures did not show on the deployed website, so the relevant links were reviewed and Cloudinary was checked to make sure that the static files were copied.


### Unfixed Bugs
- Line 128 too long in Settings.py file.
- Pictures can be compressed in order to get a better performance score on Lighthouse.


## Deployment

### Creating the Project
1. Create a new GitHub repository from the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template), clicking on "Use this template" and then "Create repository from template".
2. Once the repository has been created, open it in the GitPod workspace by clicking on the GitPod button.
3. Install Django and the relevant libraries:
  - `pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn`
  - `pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2`
  - `pip3 install 'dj3-cloudinary-storage`
4. Create a requirements.txt file:
  - `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
5. Create a new project typing: 
  - `django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME .`
  - This command creates a manage.py file and a new directory called PROJECT_NAME.
6. Create the application typing:
  - `python3 manage.py startapp APPLICATION_NAME`
7. Add the application to the list of installed apps in the settings.py file. 
  - Open the PROJECT_NAME directory, navigate to the settings.py file and add the APPLICATION_NAME to the list of the INSTALLED_APPS.
8. Migrate the changes to the database:
  - `python3 manage.py migrate`
9. Run the server:
  - `python3 manage.py runserver`
  - This command will open the project in the browser.


### Deployment to Heroku
1. Create an account or log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. On the dashboard, click on "New" and select "Create new app".
3. Give the app a unique name and select the region closest to you. Then click "Create app" to confirm.
4. To create a new database that can be accessed by Heroku, create an account or log in to [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/login).
5. Click "Create New Instance".
6. Set up your plan, giving it a name and choosing the "Tiny Turtle (free)" plan.
7. Select the Region and data center closer to you, and then click "Review" and confirm clicking on "Create instance".
8. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.
 - In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL.
9. In the project workspace, create a file called env.py and include it in the .gitignore file. 
10. In the env.py file:
  - `import os`
  - `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "copiedURL"`
  - `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "secretKEY"`
11. Open up your settings.py file and add the following code below your Path import
 `import os`
 `import dj_database_url`
 `if os.path.isfile('env.py'):`
    `import env`
12. Remove the insecure secret key provided by Django. Instead, we will reference the variable in the env.py file, so change your SECRET_KEY variable to the following
  `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`
13. Comment out the original DATABASES variable and add the code below: 
  `DATABASES = {`
     `'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))`
  `}`
14. Run the migration command in your terminal to migrate your database structure to the newly-connected ElephantSQL database:
- `python manage.py migrate`
15. In the Heroku app settings, click on the 'Reveal Config Vars' button. Create a config variable called DATABASE_URL and paste in the URL you copied from ElephantSQL. This connects the database into the app.
16. Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with SECRET_KEY.
17. Set up a Cloudinary account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
18. Copy to clipboard the API Environment Variable.
19. Add another line to the env.py file:
- `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://***"`
20. Add a new config variable in Heroku called CLOUDINARY_URL and paste the API Environment variable once again.
21. Add another config variable typing `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`.
22. Back in the settings.py file, we need to add our Cloudinary libraries to the INSTALLED_APPS list in this order:
- cloudinary_storage
- django.contrib.staticfiles
- cloudinary
23. To complete the connection with Cloudinary, add the following lines below the STATIC_URL:
- `STATICFILES_STORAGE = (`
    `'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage')`
- `STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]`
- `STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')`

- ``MEDIA_URL = '/media/'``
- ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'``
24. Back to the top of the ile settings.py, add the following line after BASE_DIR:
- `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`
25. In TEMPLATES, change the DIRS to:
- `[TEMPLATES_DIR]`
26. In ALLOWED_HOSTS, add the Heroku app and localhost to the list:
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['HEROKU_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']`
27. In the top level directory, create three folders: **media**, **static** and **templates**.
28. Create the Procfile and add the following line:
- `web: gunicorn PROJ_NAME.wsgi`
29. Save the files and push the changes:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Deployment commit`
- `git push`
30. Access Heroku and add one last config variable "PORT" (with the value 8000).
31. Open the "Deploy" tab and connect your GitHub account as a deployment method. Then search for your repository.
32. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on "Deploy branch" on the "Manual deployment section".
33. The app is successfully deployed.


### Final Deployment
1. Once the project is completed, remember to change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py.
2. Add `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN` to settings.py, just below the DEBUG, to allow the summernote editor to work.
3. Commit and push the changes, and head back to Heroku. 
4. Delete the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` among the config variables.
5. In the Deploy tab, click on "Deploy branch".
6. Click on "Open App" and the app should show in the same way as in the localhost.


The live link can be found here - [Future Home](https://future-home.herokuapp.com/)


### Forking the Repository
Forking creates your own copy of another existing repository in the remote location.
In order to fork this repository:
1. Locate the [Future Home](https://github.com/ValeP314/pp4-future-home/tree/main) repository on GitHub.
2. Select "Fork" on the top right side of the page.
3. A copy of the repository will be saved on your GitHub account.


### Cloning the repository
Cloning makes a local copy of a repository, and retains a link to its original repository. If you would like to make changes directly to a repository you have the permission to contribute to, then cloning will be the first step before we implement the actual changes and push.
1. Locate the [Future Home](https://github.com/ValeP314/pp4-future-home/tree/main) repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Code" menu and select one of the cloning options: HTTPS, SSH, and GitHub CLI, copying the link provided.
3. Open a Terminal.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
5. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier (in step 2).
6. Press "Clone" and a new clone will be created.
