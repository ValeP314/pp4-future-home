### Fixed Bugs

- Removed migrations made during design, using "python3 manage.py migrate futurehomeapp 0017", as 0017 included features that were removed before final deployment.
- Pictures did not show on the deployed website, so the relevant links were reviewed and Cloudinary was checked to make sure that the static files were copied.


### Unfixed Bugs
None
